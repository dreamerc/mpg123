Description: MPEG layer 1/2/3 audio player
 Mpg123 is a fast and portable MPEG audio player for Unix.  It supports
 MPEG 1.0/2.0 layers 1, 2 and 3 (those famous "mp3" files).
 . 
 For full CD quality playback (44 kHz, 16 bit, stereo) a Pentium,
 SPARCstation10, DEC Alpha or similar CPU is required.  Mono and/or reduced
 quality playback (22 kHz or 11 kHz) is even possible on 486 CPUs.
 .
 This package contains output plugins for several audio systems, including
 OSS/Lite, the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) on Linux systems,
 the Enlightened Sound Daemon (esound), the Network Audio System (NAS),
 and others.

Description: MPEG layer 1/2/3 audio player for i486 machines - dummy package
 Mpg123 is a fast and portable MPEG audio player for Unix.  It supports
 MPEG 1.0/2.0 layers 1, 2 and 3 (those famous "mp3" files).
